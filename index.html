                Lord Eddard Stark, also known as Ned Stark, was the head of
                House Stark, the Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, and
                later Hand of the King to King Robert I Baratheon. He was the
                older brother of Benjen, Lyanna and the younger brother of
                Brandon Stark. He is the father of Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran, and
                Rickon by his wife, Catelyn Tully, and uncle of Jon Snow, who he
                raised as his bastard son. He was a dedicated husband and
                father, a loyal friend, and an honorable lord.

                Queen Cersei I Lannister was the twentieth ruler of the Seven

                and elder sister of Tyrion Lannister. She was involved in an
                incestuous relationship with Jaime, who was secretly the father
                of her three bastard children, Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen.

                Though believed by most to be the eldest son of King Robert
                Baratheon and Queen Cersei Lannister, Joffrey is actually a
                bastard born from Cersei's incestuous relationship with her twin
                brother Jaime Lannister. He is the older brother of Myrcella and

                Queen Daenerys I Targaryen,[c] also known as Daenerys Stormborn,

                Aerys II Targaryen and Queen Rhaella, and the younger sister of
                Rhaegar and Viserys Targaryen. Daenerys was initially a timid,
                obedient youth. After her marriage to Drogo she gathered the
                confidence of his khalasar. Following his death, she expanded
                her dominion into Essos, gaining the loyalty of an army of
                Unsullied and liberating Slaver's Bay from the Ghiscari slave
                masters.

                incumbent Westerosi monarchs, Sansa, Queen in the North, and
                Brandon, King of the Andals and the First Men. After narrowly
                escaping the persecution of House Stark by House Lannister, Arya
                is trained as a Faceless Man at the House of Black and White in
                Braavos, using her abilities to avenge her family. Upon her
                return to Westeros, she exacts retribution for the Red Wedding
                by exterminating the Frey male line.

                is his cousin. Initially betrothed to Prince Joffrey Baratheon,
                the heir to the Iron Throne, Sansa travels to King's Landing in
                preparation for her nuptials, but essentially becomes a hostage
                of House Lannister following the execution of her father on
                trumped-up charges of treason. Under the (sometimes unwitting)
                tutelage of Cersei Lannister, Margaery Tyrell, and Petyr
                Baelish, Sansa becomes well-versed in politics and court
                intrigue, but suffers all the same.
